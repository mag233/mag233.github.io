It almost goes without saying that the best way to learn something new is by doing it. Yet, the actual implementation of this principle is rarely seen in practice. 

The reasons for this are manifold. Traditional education systems often prioritize theoretical knowledge over practical application. Additionally, many learners feel apprehensive about making mistakes, which can hinder their willingness to engage in hands-on learning experiences.

In work places, “real knowhow” often stays unspoken for many reasons. Experience in written documents or formal training sessions can only go so far and this type of "knowledge" is as superficial as it human language itself. True expertise is often tacit, built through repeated practice and immersion in real-world scenarios. HRs love to talk about "competency frameworks" but these are often just buzzwords that fail to capture the depth of actual skills.

For examples, most of my skills or expertise come from field observations and experiences rather than formal education. I learned to negotiate effectively by watching my boss asking tricky questions and handling objections during client or supplier meetings. Similarly, I developed project management skills by leading small projects, making mistakes, and getting shouted at by almost everyone, rather than by reading textbooks. Textbooks only help to write reports about project management to C-level executives who have never managed a project in their lives. But they do enjoy big words like "Agile" and "Scrum".

Now, with the help of AI tools, we can enhance our learning by doing. AI can provide instant feedback, simulate real-world scenarios, and offer personalized learning experiences. This allows learners to practice skills in a safe environment, make mistakes, and learn from them without the fear of real-world consequences.

The only pitfall is that AI, or LLMs, in their essence, are still language based and cannot escape the limitations of human language itself. They can simulate experiences to a certain extent, but they cannot fully replicate the nuances and complexities of real-world situations. Therefore, while AI can be a valuable tool for learning by doing, it should be used in conjunction with actual hands-on experiences whenever possible.

But coding is different. Coding is inherently a "learning by doing" activity. It is the perfect bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and magically, it is also a language based activity. When you code, you write instructions in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. This process requires you to apply theoretical concepts in a practical context, allowing you to achieve learning by doing.

We modern dwellers of the digital age are almost living in simulated realities already. We spend a significant portion of our lives interacting with digital environments, whether through social media, virtual meetings, or online gaming. These simulated realities provide ample opportunities for learning by doing, as we navigate and interact with these digital spaces.

It takes imagination and creativity to relate real-world scenarios to simulated ones. But once you master this skill, the world of learning opens up in front of you like never before. You can practice public speaking by recording yourself and analyzing the footage, or improve your writing skills by blogging and receiving feedback from readers.
